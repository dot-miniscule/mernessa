#Application identifier is hellovanessa
#This code runs in go environment, with API version go1
#Every request to a URL whos path matches the regular expression /.* (which is all URLS) should be handled by the Go program.
#The _go_app value is a string recognized by the development web server and is ignored by the production App Engine servers. 

#All Go packages for a given app are built into a single executable, and request dispatch is handled by the Go program itself. 
#This is why we have called http.HandleFunc inside the init function to associate our handler with the web root ("/")
