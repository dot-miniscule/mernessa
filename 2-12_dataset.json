If a user has autocomplete set up on their web browser, I obviously want them to be able to use that... the faster through the form the better. However, when a user is on my address field, the native autocomplete \u0026amp; the google places autocomplete end up competing with each other (native above the google places). It looks terrible, and is also a bad user experience for anyone who wanted to utilize the GP autocomplete. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy natural inclination was to simply toggle \u003ccode\u003eautocomplete=\"off\"\u003c/code\u003e on the address field (using \u003ccode\u003efocus\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eblur\u003c/code\u003e):\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e $search_address\n   //don't allow autocomplete when users are in this field as it messes with GP input\n   .on('focus', function(e){\n    $(this).attr('autocomplete', 'off'); console.log('autocomplete off');\n   })\n\n   //if the user is not in the field, allow autocomplete, or it messes with native AutoFill\n   .on('blur', function(e){\n    $(this).removeAttr('autocomplete'); console.log('autocomplete on');\n   });\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI can tell from my console logs that these are firing, however the native browser autocomplete is not being removed. I am not sure how to handle this situation. Anyone think of a way to do this or possibly know why this doesn't work?\u003c/p\u003e\n","Title":"toggling autocomplete on/off form field","Tags":null,"Closed_reason":"","Up_vote_count":0,"Down_vote_count":0,"Favorite_count":0,"View_count":0,"Owner":{"User_id":0,"Display_name":"","Reputation":0,"User_type":"","Profile_image":"","Link":""},"Comments":null,"Answers":null,"Link":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33681864/toggling-autocomplete-on-off-form-field","Is_answered":false},{"Question_id":33678931,"Last_edit_date":0,"Creation_date":1447353815,"Last_activity_date":0,"Locked_date":0,"Community_owned_date":0,"Score":0,"Answer_count":0,"Accepted_answer_id":0,"Migrated_to":{"Question_id":0,"Other_site":{"Site_type":"","Name":"","Logo_url":"","Api_site_parameter":"","Site_url":"","Audience":"","Icon_url":"","Aliases":null,"Site_state":"","Styling":{"Link_color":"","Tag_foreground_color":"","Tag_background_color":""},"Closed_beta_date":0,"Open_beta_date":0,"Launch_date":0,"Favicon_url":"","Related_sites":null,"Twitter_account":"","Markdown_extensions":null},"On_date":0},"Migrated_from":{"Question_id":0,"Other_site":{"Site_type":"","Name":"","Logo_url":"","Api_site_parameter":"","Site_url":"","Audience":"","Icon_url":"","Aliases":null,"Site_state":"","Styling":{"Link_color":"","Tag_foreground_color":"","Tag_background_color":""},"Closed_beta_date":0,"Open_beta_date":0,"Launch_date":0,"Favicon_url":"","Related_sites":null,"Twitter_account":"","Markdown_extensions":null},"On_date":0},"Bounty_closes_date":0,"Bounty_amount":0,"Closed_date":0,"Protected_date":0,"Body":"\u003cp\u003eI'm trying to use Google Places API to get the restaurants around me regarding some criterias.

using Google's Place API to Autocomplete the cities names typed by the users (webpage). The API is loaded passing the language (pt-BR) as parameter and the text box is being filled correctly in portuguese, but when the method getPlace() is executed it returns the results (country and administrative_area_level_1) in English. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI'm not sure if the problem is the Google API, their translation to portuguese or something that I missed.
